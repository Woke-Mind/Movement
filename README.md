## history

- [Stay woke, keep your eyes open](https://www.snopes.com/articles/464795/origins-term-stay-woke/)
  - The phrase was used in a 1938 recording by Black folk singer Lead Belly.

```

https://www.snopes.com/articles/464795/origins-term-stay-woke/
Lead Belly—who was born Huddie Ledbetter—said, "Stay woke, keep your eyes open."

Lead Belly - "Scottsboro Boys"
Woke's transformation into a byword of social awareness likely started decades earlier
but began to be more broadly known in 2008, with the release of
Erykah Badu's song "Master Teacher"."
In 1962, Black novelist William Melvin Kelley wrote about the term "woke" in The New York Times, titled "If You're Woke You Dig it."
He described the phrase as a "Negro idiom":
